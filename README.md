# HCI_Project1
Project 1 for HCI

This app is to be used later to test the usability of project 2. This app was designed to be a modular and customizable means of testing other apps via a user's input.

A user will first be informed of the test and be required to provide consent to participate.

Afterward, the user will be asked to provide some demographic information to be used later for data analysis. A user is allowed to input as much or as little personal information as they would like.

Once this data is collected, the user is then prompted to complete a certain number of tasks which are then asked to be further documented.

Finally, an exit survey is provided to the user for any final input.

The final screen of the app is a report of all the data acquired, for demonstrative purposes.
