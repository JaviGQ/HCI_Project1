# HCI_Project1
Project 1 for HCI

**Javier Gil**

This app is to be used later to test the usability of project 2. 
This app was designed to be a modular and customizable means of testing other apps via a user's input.
The application works as follows:

* A user will first be informed of the test and be required to provide consent to participate.

* Afterward, the user will be asked to provide some demographic information to be used later for data analysis. A user is allowed to input as much or as little personal information as they would like.

* Once this data is collected, the user is then prompted to complete a certain number of tasks which are then asked to be further documented.

* Finally, an exit survey is provided to the user for any final input.

* The final screen of the app is a report of all the data acquired, for demonstrative purposes. 

**TO RUN THIS APP**

After downloading and launching the .py file, enter streamlit run project1.py in the console.
A browser will open to access the application. From there, please proceed to use the app to test the usability of other apps.

*Note*: If the .py file name is changed, replace the name in the command with the new file name.
